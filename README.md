- 👋 Hi, I’m Yuxiang Zhang (张宇翔)
- 👀 I am currently a Post-Doctoral Fellow in the [JCLabQRS](https://jcqrs.hku.hk/) at The University of Hong Kong guided by [Prof. Shunlin Liang](https://geog.hku.hk/sl-liang). I received Ph.D. degree from Beijing Institute of Technology guided by [Prof. Tao Ran](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=afgcFuMAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Wei Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aM1sg40AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)
- 🌱 I’m interested in intelligent interpretation of remote sensing images (including foundation models, classification, segmentation, change detection, transfer learning, etc.), and remote sensing image restoration (single-temporal/long-sequence cloud removal, prediction).
